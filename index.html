      <h2><u>Data Analytics - Evolutionary Ladder</u></h2>

      <ul>
        <li>Essential Theory: GDPR-Compliant Sentence To Schema Operational Dataset Designer</li>
        <li>Data Analysis: Strategic Questions, Dashboard</li>
        <li>AI: Analysed Data -> Connected To An LLM -> Using Prompts, To Generate Reports Which Tell The Story Behind Each Chart Inside The Dashboard</li>
      </ul>

      <h2><u>Learning Plan:</u></h2>

      <p><a href="#Lesson 3">Lesson 3 - AI</a></p>

      <h2 id="Lesson 1"><u>Lesson 1 - Essential Theory</u></h2>
      <h2>General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Lawful Basis – Legal reason for collecting and processing personal data (e.g. consent, contract, legal obligation).</li>
    <li>Transparency – Inform individuals about how their data is used, stored and shared.</li>
    <li>Data Minimisation – Only collect the data truly needed.</li>
    <li>Accuracy – Keep the data up to date and correct errors.</li>
    <li>Storage Limitation – Do not keep the data longer than required</li>
    <li>Security – Protect the data using appropriate technical and organisational measures.</li>
    <li>Rights Of Individuals – People possess rights under the GDPR (access, rectification, erasure, portability, objection)</li>
    <li>Accountability – Organisations must demonstrate compliance (documentation, policies, audits)</li>
</ol>
<p>Data analysts must demonstrate full compliance and respect these principles, each piece of the puzzle, in turn helps carve an helpful and fruitful data analytics project.</p>

<h2>Define Question – Analytical Anchor:</h2>
<p><strong>Product:</strong> A tangible or intangible offering as the subject of analysis.<br>
e.g. Cricket equipment such as bats, balls and wickets.</p>

<p><strong>Service:</strong> A process or activity which supports, delivers or enables the product.<br>
e.g. Sales and purchases transactions moving products between stakeholders.</p>

<p>If at all performing data analysis, is recommended, a question is defined, revealing whether the analysis is product-centric or service-centric.</p>
<p>The definitive question sets the DA ladder in motion, and creates an inquiry driven framework.</p>

<p><strong>Product Analysis:</strong> To monitor the performance, uptake, and profitability of the product in and of itself.</p>
<p><strong>Service Analysis:</strong> To monitor the processes around the product whether are operational (e.g. business service) or relational (e.g. customer service).</p>

<h2>Evolving Through The Domains Of DA:</h2>
<p><strong>DA Ladder:</strong></p>
<ol>
    <li>Descriptive Analytics – What did happen?</li>
    <li>Diagnostic Analytics – Why it did happen?</li>
    <li>Predictive Analytics – What is likely to happen in the future?</li>
    <li>Prescriptive Analytics – What ought to be done now?</li>
</ol>

<h2>Data Level, Information Level & Insight</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Dataset</li>
    <li>Dashboard</li>
    <li>Report</li>
</ol>

      <h3><u>Step 2: Four Basic Domains Of Data Analysis To Answer Strategic Questions:</u></h3>
      <p><strong>1. For Each Strategic Question:</strong></p>
      <ol>
        <li>Descriptive Analytics - What Happened?</li>
        <li>Diagnostic Analytics - Why It Happened?</li>
        <li>Prescriptive Analytics - What Ought To Happen Now?</li>
        <li>Predictive Analytics - What Is Expected To Happen In The Future?</li>

       <ol>
         <li>Answers To Strategic Questions</li>
         <li>Sent To The LLM Using Prompts</li>
         <li>LLM Produces Detailed Reports</li>
         <li>Reports Represent Stories Complementary To The Dashboard Charts</li>
       </ol>
