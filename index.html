      <h2>General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Lawful Basis – Legal reason for collecting and processing personal data (e.g. consent, contract, legal obligation).</li>
    <li>Transparency – Inform individuals about how their data is used, stored and shared.</li>
    <li>Data Minimisation – Only collect the data truly needed.</li>
    <li>Accuracy – Keep the data up to date and correct errors.</li>
    <li>Storage Limitation – Do not keep the data longer than required</li>
    <li>Security – Protect the data using appropriate technical and organisational measures.</li>
    <li>Rights Of Individuals – People possess rights under the GDPR (access, rectification, erasure, portability, objection)</li>
    <li>Accountability – Organisations must demonstrate compliance (documentation, policies, audits)</li>
</ol>
<p>Data analysts must demonstrate full compliance and respect these principles, each piece of the puzzle, in turn helps carve an helpful and fruitful data analytics project.</p>

<h2>Define Question – Analytical Anchor:</h2>
<p><strong>Product:</strong> A tangible or intangible offering as the subject of analysis.<br>
e.g. Cricket equipment such as bats, balls and wickets.</p>

<p><strong>Service:</strong> A process or activity which supports, delivers or enables the product.<br>
e.g. Sales and purchases transactions moving products between stakeholders.</p>

<p>If at all performing data analysis, is recommended, a question is defined, revealing whether the analysis is product-centric or service-centric.</p>
<p>The definitive question sets the DA ladder in motion, and creates an inquiry driven framework.</p>

<p><strong>Product Analysis:</strong> To monitor the performance, uptake, and profitability of the product in and of itself.</p>
<p><strong>Service Analysis:</strong> To monitor the processes around the product whether are operational (e.g. business service) or relational (e.g. customer service).</p>
