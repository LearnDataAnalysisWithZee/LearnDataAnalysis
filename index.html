      <h3>ðŸ”— Input Channels Process</h3>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Central Entity</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Strong Synonym</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Organisational Terms</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Expose Descriptive Features</strong></li>
      </ol>

      <h4>ðŸ“Œ Central Entity</h4>
      <p>
        Central Entity is derived from the title of the application. For example, if the application is <em>Activity Tracker</em>, then the Central Entity is <strong>Activity</strong>. If it's <em>Expenses Tracker</em>, then the Central Entity is <strong>Expenses</strong>.
      </p>

      <h4>ðŸ“Œ Strong Synonym</h4>
      <p>
        We identify the strongest synonym for the Central Entity. For instance, the strongest synonym for <strong>Activity</strong> is <em>Task</em>, and for <strong>Expenses</strong> it is <em>Expenditures</em>. This synonym becomes the first Input Channel or Data Divisionâ€”commonly referred to as a field.
      </p>

      <h4>ðŸ“Œ Organisational Terms</h4>
      <p>
        These are universal terms that strengthen the input structure. If <strong>Task</strong> is the first field, organisational terms like <em>Date</em> and <em>Time</em> help structure the input. The full list includes:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Date</li>
        <li>Time</li>
        <li>Location</li>
        <li>Session Activities / Session Expenses (based on Central Entity)</li>
        <li>Status</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Note: The fourth term dynamically reflects the plural of the Central Entity. For <strong>Activity</strong>, it's <em>Session Activities</em>. For <strong>Expenses</strong>, it's <em>Session Expenses</em>. This reflects the reality that multiple activities or expenses may occur during a single session.
      </p>

      <h4>ðŸ“Œ Expose Descriptive Features</h4>
      <p>
        This final layer of the Input Channels Process adds <strong>Categorisation</strong> and <strong>Importance</strong> to enrich the data structure. These features are universal and allow deeper exploration as data entries grow.
      </p>
      <p>
        The benefits of Categorisation and Importance include surfacing key insights and adding a storytelling dimension to each record. An optional field, <strong>Notes</strong>, further enhances this by capturing context and nuanceâ€”revealing patterns and meaning after just a few entries.
      </p>

      <p class="educational-note">ðŸŽ“ This framework supports structured input design for scalable data analysisâ€”ideal for transforming raw entries into meaningful insights.</p>

  <h3>ðŸ“Š Data Divisions - From An Idea To Continuity:</h3>

  <h4>Idea/Conceptual Layer:</h4>
  <p>
    Here Is Speculated What Data Will Be Retrieved, No Real Consideration Can Be Made Yet However What Has Started Is The Desire To Perform Data Operations In Respect To The Idea, As An Example, Expenses Tracker Or Activity Tracker, Being Core Ideas Yet Without Any Guiding Principles.
    Therefore, Is Introduced The Input Channel Process (Study Previous Part) Which Introduces A Formal Way By Which Data Can Be Retrieved.
    The Efficient Retrieval Of Data In No Way Is Sufficient As Is Only Logic Behind The Conceptual Layer, The Theory Indeed But Not Thorough Enough, The Idea Has Evolved And Further Helped, Storing Data, But With All Of This Data Come Complicated Questionâ€™s, In Fact So Complex, Suffices Not To Mention Here.
    Getting On With It, What Now Becomes A Requirement Is The Logic That Will Transform This Idea Into A Physical Phenomenon.
  </p>

  <h4>Key Point To Remember:</h4>
  <p><strong>â€˜Only Available Data Shall = Data Divisionâ€™</strong></p>

  <p>
    We Have Already Mentioned How We Have The Data Now, There Is A Influx Of Data Being Streamlined Into Each Of The Input Channels (Fields) On A Regular Basis. Itâ€™s Implausible To Identify, Even Now, What The Relationship Between The Field(Input Channel) And Valueâ€™s Inside Them Are Trying To Highlight.
    Well, Seeing As We Only Have The Available Data, And To Each Itâ€™s Own, Input Channel, We Can Only Detach The Input Channels From Input Channels And Re-Attach Them To The Input Channels.
    Why Not Do This For Each Input Channel? And Yes, Here Appear The Data Divisions Or Do They?
  </p>

  <h4>So, What Data Divisions Are There Then?</h4>
  <p>
    Well The Suggestion â€˜Detach The Input Channels From Input Channels And Re-Attach Them To The Input Channelsâ€™ Is Close But Letâ€™s Refine, The Central Entity And Itâ€™s Strongest Synonym Or The First Input Channel Needâ€™s To Be Recalled. And What Had Followed Namely The Universal Organisational Terms.
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Join Input Channel Two To Input Channel One, This Pair Is A Unique Data Division.</li>
    <li>Likewise Join Input Channel Three To Input Channel One, This Too Is Its Own Data Division.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
  This Will Stop At The End Of The Organisational Terms, Which Are Six (Study Part 1). These Data Divisions Provide With Far More Clarity As To The Relationship Between The Input Channels And The Values Residing In Each One.
  <br><br>
  <strong>Key Point To Remember:</strong>
  <br>
  â€˜A Data Division Is Two Input Channels That Are Combined, The First Is Always, The First Input Channel, The Stronger Synonym Of The Central Entity And The Second Is Always One Of The Input Channels Which Are Organisational Terms.â€™
</p>
      
  <h4>What Now, That The Data Divisions Have Been Identified?</h4>
  <p>
    Now That There Is,
    â€˜Far More Clarity As To The Relationship Between The Input Channels And The Values Residing In Each Oneâ€™
    What We Can Do Is, Statistical Analysis, Whereby The Count Of Occurrences Of Each Value Is Mapped To Itâ€™s Associative Input Channel Demonstrating The Data Division As An Enhanced Attribute Of The Input Channels.
    Further The Statistical Analysis Is Used To Enhance Conventional Data Analytics In A Complementary Manner To Answer Questions Like What Happened? (Descriptive Analytics), Why Did It Happen? (Diagnostic Analytics) So On So Forth.
    The Result Here Being A Dashboard With Tables And Charts Explaining A Lot More Of, What Was Previously Hidden.
  </p>

  <h4>Why Do We Need A Dashboard?</h4>
  <p>
    A Dashboard Will Constantly Be Updated As The Data In The Data Set Increases, And This Increased Insight Will Result In New Solutions Becoming A Necessity, And The Three Input Channels, Which Expose Descriptive Features (Study Part 1), Will Help To Lay The Foundation For The New Solutions As Automated Flowâ€™s Which Make The Entire Way From Idea To The Physical Implementation An Continual Process Whereby Solutions In The Future Will Too Improve.
