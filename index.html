        <li><strong>Central Entity</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Strong Synonym</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Organisational Terms</strong></li>

      </ol>

      <h4>ðŸ“Œ Central Entity</h4>
      <p>
        Central Entity is derived from the title of the application. For example, if the application is <em>Activity Tracker</em>, then the Central Entity is <strong>Activity</strong>. If it's <em>Expenses Tracker</em>, then the Central Entity is <strong>Expenses</strong>.
      </p>

      <h4>ðŸ“Œ Strong Synonym</h4>
      <p>
        We identify the strongest synonym for the Central Entity. For instance, the strongest synonym for <strong>Activity</strong> is <em>Task</em>, and for <strong>Expenses</strong> it is <em>Expenditures</em>. This synonym becomes the first Input Channel or Data Divisionâ€”commonly referred to as a field.
      </p>

      <h4>ðŸ“Œ Organisational Terms</h4>
      <p>
        These are universal terms that strengthen the input structure. If <strong>Task</strong> is the first field, organisational terms like <em>Date</em> and <em>Time</em> help structure the input. The full list includes:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Date</li>
        <li>Time</li>
        <li>Location</li>
        <li>Session Activities / Session Expenses (based on Central Entity)</li>
        <li>Status</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Note: The fourth term dynamically reflects the plural of the Central Entity. For <strong>Activity</strong>, it's <em>Session Activities</em>. For <strong>Expenses</strong>, it's <em>Session Expenses</em>. This reflects the reality that multiple activities or expenses may occur during a single session.
      </p>

      <h4>ðŸ“Œ Expose Descriptive Features</h4>
      <p>
        This final layer of the Input Channels Process adds <strong>Categorisation</strong> and <strong>Importance</strong> to enrich the data structure. These features are universal and allow deeper exploration as data entries grow.
      </p>
      <p>
        The benefits of Categorisation and Importance include surfacing key insights and adding a storytelling dimension to each record. An optional field, <strong>Notes</strong>, further enhances this by capturing context and nuanceâ€”revealing patterns and meaning after just a few entries.
      </p>

      <p class="educational-note">ðŸŽ“ This framework supports structured input design for scalable data analysisâ€”ideal for transforming raw entries into meaningful insights.</p>
