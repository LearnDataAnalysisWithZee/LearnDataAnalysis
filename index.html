      <h4>Lesson 1 - Power Query Editor - Data Cleaning Basics</h4>
      <p>It Is Important For A Business To Analyse The Data Available On The Product They Trade In.</p>
      <p>A Data Analyst Will Use The Latest Information On The Products Performance For In Order To Reveal The Extent To Which The Product Is Benefitting The Business And Also Exactly How So.</p>
      <p>A Collection Of Common Techniques Also Referred To As, ‘Data Cleaning’, Are Applied To A Product Centric Data Set To Prepare It To Present It’s Performance Across The Business Timeline.</p>
      <p>Depending On The Industry The Specifics Of A Data Set Will Vary However The Data Cleaning Techniques Which Will Be Used To Clean A Data Set Here Can Be Used To Prepare Data Set’s For Any Business.</p>
      <p>A Data Set Is Extracted From A Data Source, Within A Data Lake Where Exist Journals, Logs, Audits, And Anymore Semi-Structured Files Relevant To The Business Operations.</p>
      <p>The Data Lake Resides In The Cloud, Making It Accessible To More Than One Data Analyst (If Permitted) At The Same Time, From Anywhere In The World. The Data Lake Does What It Says Or What A Lake Is For, Has The Ability To Clean Data Therefore Transform Data To Be Insightful.</p>
      <p>The Data Source Which Is Going To Be Used Here Is A Log, In The Form Of A Spreadsheet From Where We Will Extract The Main Data Set Which Is Holding The Most Central Information About The Product The Business Sells.</p>
      <p>The Easy Way Is Often The Best Way, As The More A Data Set Has Been Simplified, The Analysis Performed Will Be That Much More Clarified And For This Reason The Data Set Will Be Cleaned, Where We Will Be Detecting Inconsistencies And Standardising The Data, Preparing It Before Returning It As The Data Source, For Data Reporting And Visualisation.</p>
      <p>Before Getting Into The Data Set And Starting Cleaning Is Essential To Be Comfortable With The Project Structure So Is Known What Is Where And Why.</p>

      <p>Let Us Summarise:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Cloud – The environment where the ‘Data Lake’ is hosted or lives.</li>
        <li>Data Lake – The location where files encapsulating business operations exist in a semi-structured format.</li>
        <li>Data Source – A file inside the ‘Data Lake’ which contains the information essential to analyse.</li>
        <li>Data Set – Extracted from within the ‘Data Source’, representing essential business operations—often the Main Product Details column, crucial to discern Product Performance across a timeline.</li>
        <li>Data Cleaning – A series of techniques used to transform the otherwise messy Data Set into actionable insights.</li>
      </ol>

      <p><strong>Activity:</strong></p>
      <p>Let’s Get Down To Business, The Data Set Which Will Be Cleaned, Is For A Cricket Equipment Outlet*. A Spreadsheet Log Will Be The Data Source Inside The Data Lake, Which Has The Key Information Which We Will Use To Transform To Prepare A Financial Statement For The Business Account. With Our Task Briefed This Particular Activity Will Solely Focus On Gaining An Insight Into How To Clean Data So That No Matter What The Data Set Data Cleaning or Preparation Becomes An Easier Task.</p>
      <p><i>*The Cricket Equipment Outlet Is A Fictitious Company And The Data Used Here Is Only Dummy Data, Used For Learning Data Cleaning Which Itself Does Not Change No Matter The Industry As Discussed At The Start Of The Data Cleaning Lesson.</i></p>
