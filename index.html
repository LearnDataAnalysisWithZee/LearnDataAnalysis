                <details class="qa-block">
                    <summary>Q: What is programming?</summary>
                    <div>
                        <p><strong>Programming</strong> is the art and science of giving instructions to a computer so it can perform specific tasks. These tasks can range from adding two numbers to building interactive websites, mobile apps, or intelligent systems.</p>

                        <p>Think of programming like **writing a recipe** for a machine. If you want it to bake a cake, you must describe every step: gather ingredients, mix, bake, cool, decorate. A computer can’t "guess" what you mean—it needs everything explained with precision.</p>

                        <h4>🧠 Why is it useful?</h4>
                        <p>Programming gives us the power to create tools, automate work, solve problems, and turn ideas into digital experiences. It’s behind everything from calculators and banking systems to search engines and video games.</p>

                        <h4>🔄 Programming connects data to actions</h4>
                        <p>At its core, programming is about taking **data** (like a user's name, a temperature, or a button press) and using logic to decide **what happens next**. It tells the computer how to react.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>📥 If the user types their name, display a greeting.</li>
                            <li>📈 If the temperature rises, activate the fan.</li>
                            <li>✅ If the quiz score is over 80, show “Well done!”</li>
                        </ul>

                        <p>This interaction is what makes apps feel “smart.” The user sees visuals (text, buttons, feedback), but behind the scenes, the program is constantly thinking: <em>“What’s the data? What should I do with it?”</em></p>

                        <h4>🔧 Analogy: Programming is like building a vending machine</h4>
                        <p>A vending machine responds to input (money + button press) and gives an output (a snack!). The logic inside decides what to do when certain buttons are pressed, and how to respond if there’s not enough credit. That’s programming—it connects inputs to outputs using logic.</p>

                        <h4>🚀 In short:</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Programming is a way to describe instructions</strong> that a machine can carry out.</li>
                            <li><strong>It transforms data into action</strong>.</li>
                            <li><strong>It allows us to build anything from a calculator to a chatbot</strong>.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <p>And just like any language, the more you practice, the more fluently you can express your ideas—and the more powerful the tools you can build.</p>

                <h2>Data</h2>

                <details class="qa-block">
                    <summary>Q: How does data relate to programming?</summary>
                    <div>
                        <p><strong>Data</strong> is at the heart of programming. It’s the raw material that programs work with—facts, values, input from users, sensor readings, or results of calculations. Without data, programs would have nothing to process or respond to.</p>

                        <h4>📦 Analogy: A Program is a Kitchen, Data is the Ingredients</h4>
                        <p>Think of a program like a kitchen and data as the ingredients. The recipes (code) say what to do—boil, mix, bake—but without ingredients (data), nothing meaningful can be made.</p>

                        <h4>💡 Where does data come from?</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>📥 User input – typing a name, selecting a product</li>
                            <li>⏳ System info – current time, file size</li>
                            <li>🌐 External sources – data from websites, spreadsheets</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h4>📍 Where is data stored during a program’s lifetime?</h4>
                        <p>When a program runs, it stores data in **variables** (temporary containers in memory). These variables last only while the program is active—once it closes, the data disappears unless it's saved elsewhere.</p>

                        <pre><code>Dim score As Integer = 90 ' score lives while the program runs</code></pre>

                        <h4>💾 How do we keep data after the program ends?</h4>
                        <p>This is called <strong>data persistence</strong>. We save the data to an external file or service so it’s available the next time the program runs. Common options include:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Text Files:</strong> Save simple lines of data like logs, scores, or configs.</li>
                            <li><strong>Spreadsheets:</strong> Great for tabular data—like quiz results or inventories.</li>
                            <li><strong>Databases:</strong> Powerful for storing large, structured datasets (like users, purchases, etc.).</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h4>📘 Example: Saving a Quiz Score</h4>
                        <p>Let’s say a user scores 8 out of 10 in a quiz. If we don’t store it, the result is lost when the program closes. But if we write it to a file:</p>
                        <pre><code>File.WriteAllText("score.txt", "Latest Score: 8/10")</code></pre>
                        <p>Now that score can be opened later—even if the app was closed!</p>

                        <h4>🧠 In Summary:</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Data powers the decision-making</strong> in programs.</li>
                            <li><strong>Variables hold data temporarily</strong> while a program runs.</li>
                            <li><strong>Files, spreadsheets, or databases persist data</strong> after the program exits.</li>
                        </ul>

                <h2>Variables</h2>

                <details class="qa-block">
                    <summary>Q: What is a variable in programming?</summary>
                    <div>
                        <p>A <strong>variable</strong> is like a labeled container in your program that holds information you want to use or change later. It might store a name, a score, a price, or anything else your program needs to remember while it runs.</p>

                        <h4>🎁 Analogy: A Variable is a Labeled Box</h4>
                        <p>Imagine a stack of boxes, each with a name on the front: <em>name, age, score</em>. Inside each box is a value. You can take something out, replace it, or look inside whenever you need it. That’s how variables work.</p>

                        <pre><code>Dim score As Integer = 90
Dim name As String = "Ahmed"</code></pre>

                        <h4>🧮 Analogy: A Variable is Like a Column in a Table</h4>
                        <p>If you've used a spreadsheet or a database, think of each <strong>column</strong> as a variable—“Name”, “Score”, “Age”. Each row has a different value, but the <em>column defines what kind of data</em> goes there.</p>

                        <p>In a program, a variable acts like a <em>single cell from one column</em>. For example:</p>
                        <pre><code>' Think of this as Row 1, Column “Name”
Dim studentName As String = "Zoya"</code></pre>

                        <p>So variables are like the columns your code works with—one value at a time, stored with a name and type.</p>

                        <h4>🧠 Why are variables important?</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>📋 Store a user’s input (e.g. name or answer)</li>
                            <li>🧮 Keep track of progress (e.g. score in a quiz)</li>
                            <li>🔁 Feed into conditions and loops (e.g. retry count)</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h4>🕰️ How long do variables last?</h4>
                        <p>By default, variables live only while the program is running. Once it ends, the variables (and their values) vanish—unless stored in a file or database.</p>

                        <h4>📘 Example: Storing an age</h4>
                        <pre><code>Dim age As Integer = 17
If age >= 18 Then
    Console.WriteLine("You’re an adult.")
Else
    Console.WriteLine("You’re a minor.")
End If</code></pre>

                        <h4>🔍 In Summary:</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Variables are named labels for values</strong> that change during a program.</li>
                            <li><strong>They act like individual cells or fields in a table</strong>.</li>
                            <li><strong>They help programs work with data, remember things, and make decisions.</strong></li>
                        </ul>

                <details class="qa-block">
                    <summary>Q: What is a data type in programming?</summary>
                    <div>
                        <p>A <strong>data type</strong> defines the kind of value a variable can hold—whether it's a number, a word, a true/false flag, or something more complex like a date or a list. It tells the program how much space to reserve and how to interpret the value.</p>

                        <h4>🗃️ Analogy: Data Types Are Labels on Boxes</h4>
                        <p>Imagine you're sorting items into labeled boxes: one says “Books”, one says “Coins”, another says “Letters”. You wouldn’t mix them. A <strong>data type</strong> is like that label—it ensures the variable holds only the right kind of content.</p>

                        <pre><code>Dim age As Integer = 25
Dim name As String = "Amina"
Dim passed As Boolean = True</code></pre>

                        <h4>📊 Analogy: Data Types Are Like Spreadsheet Column Formats</h4>
                        <p>If you've used Excel or a database, you’ve seen column formats like “Number”, “Text”, or “Date”. That’s exactly what data types are in programming—each column is expected to store a certain type of data, and you get an error if you try to mix types.</p>

                        <ul>
                            <li>✔️ They help the computer reserve the right amount of memory.</li>
                            <li>✔️ They prevent bugs by catching wrong assignments early (e.g. mixing numbers and text).</li>
                            <li>✔️ They improve performance and make your code clearer to read.</li>

                            In Excel, you can use a formula like:
                            <code>=IF(A2 &gt;= 60, "Pass", "Fail")</code>
                        </p>

                        <p>This formula checks the condition (Is the value in A2 at least 60?). If it’s true, it returns “Pass”; otherwise, “Fail.” That’s exactly what a program does too—it checks a value and responds accordingly.</p>

                    <div>
                        <p>Think of an <strong>array</strong> as a column or row in a spreadsheet where all the cells contain the same type of data—like scores, names, or dates. It's a way to store multiple values under one variable name and refer to them by their position.</p>

                        <h4>📊 Spreadsheet Analogy</h4>

                        </table>

                        <p>In a program, you’d store those values like this:</p>
                        <pre><code>Dim scores() As Integer = {85, 90, 78, 92}</code></pre>

                        <p>Each row (B2, B3, B4, etc.) becomes an item in the array, accessed by index:</p>
                        <pre><code>Console.WriteLine(scores(1)) ' Shows: 90 (just like B3)</code></pre>

                            <li><strong>Each value is accessed by index</strong>—just like referencing a row number</li>
                            <li><strong>You can loop through an array</strong> just like dragging a formula down a column</li>

                    <div>
                        <p>A <strong>list</strong> is a flexible, growable collection that stores multiple values. It’s like an improved version of an array—you don’t need to know how many items you’ll have in advance, and you can add or remove items easily as your program runs.</p>

                        <h4>🛒 Analogy: A Shopping Basket</h4>
                        <p>If an <em>array</em> is an egg carton (fixed number of slots), a <strong>list</strong> is a shopping basket—you can drop in as many items as needed, in any order, and change things on the fly.</p>

                        <pre><code>' VB.NET Example
Dim fruits As New List(Of String)
fruits.Add("Apple")

                        <h4>📌 Why Lists Matter</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>✅ You don’t have to specify size ahead of time</li>
                            <li>➕ You can Add, Remove, Insert, or Sort with ease</li>
                            <li>🚀 Great for reading from files, forms, and user entries</li>

                        <p>
                            <strong>Input</strong> is how your program receives data—from the keyboard, mouse, file, or another system.
                            <strong>Output</strong> is how your program shares information back—by showing messages, writing files, or displaying on screen.

                                <li>👂 You <strong>listen</strong> to what the other person says → <em>that's input</em>.</li>
                                <li>🗣️ You <strong>respond</strong> with your own words → <em>that's output</em>.</li>
                            </ul>
                            Programming works the same way: take something in, process it, then send something out.

                            <li><strong>Input</strong> brings data into your program—from the user, a file, or another system</li>
                            <li><strong>Output</strong> sends data out—from your program to the screen, a file, or the web</li>

                <details class="qa-block">
                    <summary>Q: What is a method in programming?</summary>
                    <div>
                        <p>A <strong>method</strong> (also called a function or procedure) is a named block of code that performs a specific task. You write it once, and then you can "call" it wherever you need to run that task—just like a mini-program inside your program.</p>

                        <h4>🔧 Analogy: A Blender Button</h4>
                        <p>Think of a kitchen blender. When you press “Blend,” you don’t need to know what each motor part does. You just push the button and the whole action runs. That button is a method—it hides the details and performs a job when called.</p>

                        <h4>📘 Example: Defining and Calling a Method</h4>
                        <pre><code>' Method definition
Sub Greet()
    Console.WriteLine("Hello, friend!")
End Sub

' Method call
Greet()</code></pre>

                        <p><code>Greet()</code> is the method call. It activates the block of code defined in <code>Sub Greet()</code>.</p>

                        <h4>🎯 Why Use Methods?</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>♻️ Reuse code instead of repeating yourself</li>
                            <li>🧹 Keep your program organized and readable</li>
                            <li>🧪 Make it easier to test and update parts of your program</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h4>📥 Methods with Parameters (Input)</h4>
                        <pre><code>Sub GreetUser(name As String)
    Console.WriteLine("Hello, " & name & "!")
End Sub

GreetUser("Ahmed")</code></pre>
                        <p>The method now takes <code>name</code> as input (a parameter), making it flexible and reusable.</p>

                        <h4>📤 Methods that Return a Value</h4>
                        <pre><code>Function Square(x As Integer) As Integer
    Return x * x
End Function

Dim result As Integer = Square(5)  ' result = 25</code></pre>
                        <p><code>Function</code> returns a result you can store, use, or display.</p>

                        <h4>📊 Spreadsheet Analogy: Custom Formula</h4>
                        <p>In Excel, formulas like <code>=SUM(A2:A5)</code> are built-in methods. You give them inputs (A2:A5), and they return a result. In programming, you can make your own!</p>

                        <h4>🧠 In Summary:</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Methods are named blocks of reusable code</strong></li>
                            <li><strong>They can accept input (parameters) and return output (results)</strong></li>
                            <li><strong>They organize logic, reduce repetition, and work like buttons in a machine</strong></li>

                    <div>
                        <p>A <strong>function</strong> is a named block of code that <em>returns a value</em>. It's just like a method, but instead of only doing something (like printing), it calculates a result and gives it back. That result can then be used, stored, or displayed elsewhere.</p>

                        <h4>🧮 Analogy: A Calculator Button</h4>
                        <p>When you press "Square Root" on a calculator, you get a specific result. A function is like that—it takes an input, works out the answer, and returns it.</p>

                        <h4>📘 Example: A Function That Calculates a Square</h4>
                        <pre><code>Function Square(x As Integer) As Integer

End Function

Dim result As Integer = Square(6) ' result = 36</code></pre>

                        <h4>📥 Functions with Parameters</h4>
                        <p>Just like a math formula takes input, a function can too:</p>
                        <pre><code>Function Add(a As Integer, b As Integer) As Integer
    Return a + b
End Function

Dim total As Integer = Add(3, 4) ' total = 7</code></pre>

                        <pre><code>Function Greet(name As String) As String
    Return "Hello, " & name & "!"
End Function

Console.WriteLine(Greet("Zee")) ' Outputs: Hello, Zee!</code></pre>

                    <summary>Q: What is exception handling in programming?</summary>
                    <div>
                        <p><strong>Exception handling</strong> is how a program deals with unexpected problems—like trying to divide by zero, access a missing file, or convert text that isn’t a number. Instead of crashing, the program catches the error and responds safely.</p>

                        <h4>🚨 Analogy: A Fire Alarm System</h4>
                        <p>Imagine your building has a fire alarm. You don’t want to panic every time something goes wrong—you want a system in place to detect, respond, and recover. Exception handling is like that safety system for your code.</p>

                        <h4>🧱 Try–Catch Structure</h4>
                        <pre><code>Try
    ' Code that might cause an error
    Dim number As Integer = CInt(Console.ReadLine())
    Console.WriteLine("You entered: " & number)
Catch ex As Exception
    Console.WriteLine("That wasn't a valid number.")
End Try</code></pre>

                        <h4>🔍 Example: Dividing by Zero</h4>
                        <pre><code>Try
    Dim x As Integer = 10
    Dim y As Integer = 0
    Dim result As Integer = x \ y
    Console.WriteLine(result)
Catch ex As DivideByZeroException
    Console.WriteLine("Cannot divide by zero.")
End Try</code></pre>

                        <h4>🚪 Finally Block</h4>
                        <p>Used when you always want to run some code, whether there was an error or not:</p>
                        <pre><code>Try
    ' risky code
Catch
    ' handle error
Finally
    Console.WriteLine("Program ended.")
End Try</code></pre>

                        <h4>📊 Spreadsheet Analogy: IFERROR</h4>
                        <p>
                            In Excel, if you use <code>=A1/B1</code> and B1 is 0, you’ll get a <code>#DIV/0!</code> error. But if you use:
                            <code>=IFERROR(A1/B1, "Invalid")</code>
                            it catches the error and gives a custom result—just like <code>Try...Catch</code> in code.

                <details class="qa-block">
                    <summary>Q: How can I save data from my console app into a text file in the project folder?</summary>
                    <div>
                        <p>Sometimes you don’t want to just display data—you want to <strong>save it permanently</strong> so it can be accessed again later. This is called <strong>persistence</strong>, and it’s super easy using a plain text file in VB.NET.</p>

                        <h4>📁 Where Does It Save?</h4>
                        <p>By default, your program’s working folder is the <code>bin\Debug</code> or <code>bin\Release</code> directory of your project. You can write files here without needing extra file paths.</p>

                        <h4>🧱 Will the File Be Created Automatically?</h4>
                        <p>Yes! If the file doesn’t already exist, <strong>VB.NET will automatically create it</strong> the first time you write to it using <code>File.AppendAllText()</code> or <code>StreamWriter</code>. If the file already exists, your data will be <strong>appended to the end</strong>.</p>

                        <h4>📜 Basic Save to Text File</h4>
                        <pre><code>' Save a simple message to a file called "log.txt"
Dim message As String = "User logged in at " & Now.ToString()

File.AppendAllText("log.txt", message & Environment.NewLine)</code></pre>

                        <h4>📦 Save Structured Input (like CSV)</h4>
                        <pre><code>' Capture input from user
Console.Write("Enter Name: ")
Dim name = Console.ReadLine()

Console.Write("Enter Age: ")
Dim age = Console.ReadLine()

Dim line = name & "," & age

' Save to a CSV-like text file
File.AppendAllText("people.txt", line & Environment.NewLine)</code></pre>

                        <h4>⚙️ Alternative Using StreamWriter</h4>
                        <pre><code>Using writer As StreamWriter = File.AppendText("users.txt")
    writer.WriteLine("Zee,Logged in at " & Now.ToString())
End Using</code></pre>

                        <h4>🧯 Add Error Protection</h4>
                        <pre><code>Try
    File.AppendAllText("data.txt", "Saved at: " & Now.ToString() & Environment.NewLine)
Catch ex As Exception
    Console.WriteLine("Failed to save data: " & ex.Message)
End Try</code></pre>

                        <h4>🧠 In Summary:</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>The file is auto-created if it doesn’t exist</strong></li>
                            <li><strong>Data is appended, not erased</strong>, with each run</li>
                            <li><strong>Structured text (like CSV)</strong> is perfect for logging entries</li>
                            <li><strong>Error handling ensures safe saving</strong> every time</li>
                        </ul>

                <h2>Reading Data from a Text File</h2>

                <details class="qa-block">
                    <summary>Q: How can my console app display data that was saved earlier in a text file?</summary>
                    <div>
                        <p>Now that you're saving data to files like <code>data.txt</code> or <code>people.txt</code>, the next step is reading that data back into your program—so users can see what was stored.</p>

                        <h4>📖 Read All Lines from a File</h4>
                        <pre><code>If File.Exists("people.txt") Then
    Dim lines() As String = File.ReadAllLines("people.txt")

    For Each line In lines
        Console.WriteLine(line)
    Next
Else
    Console.WriteLine("No records found.")
End If</code></pre>

                        <p>This loads all lines as an array and prints them, line by line. Works great for simple CSV-style logs.</p>

                        <h4>🔍 Bonus: Split Each Entry into Columns</h4>
                        <pre><code>Dim lines = File.ReadAllLines("people.txt")

For Each line In lines
    Dim parts = line.Split(","c)
    Console.WriteLine("Name: " & parts(0) & " | Age: " & parts(1))
Next</code></pre>

                        <p>This breaks each line into fields so you can format or analyze individual values like name, score, or timestamp.</p>

                        <h4>⏱️ Read Only the Last Entry</h4>
                        <pre><code>Dim lines = File.ReadAllLines("people.txt")
If lines.Length > 0 Then
    Dim lastLine = lines.Last()
    Console.WriteLine("Latest entry: " & lastLine)
End If</code></pre>

                        <h4>📥 Read with StreamReader (Advanced)</h4>
                        <p>This method gives more control—especially for reading large files line by line:</p>
                        <pre><code>Using reader As New StreamReader("people.txt")
    While Not reader.EndOfStream
        Dim entry = reader.ReadLine()
        Console.WriteLine(entry)
    End While
End Using</code></pre>

                        <h4>🧠 In Summary:</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Use <code>File.ReadAllLines()</code></strong> to quickly load all entries</li>
                            <li><strong>Split each line using <code>.Split()</code></strong> if you want to analyze fields</li>
                            <li><strong>Always check <code>File.Exists()</code></strong> before reading</li>
                            <li><strong>Use <code>StreamReader</code> for larger or real-time files</strong></li>
                        </ul>
