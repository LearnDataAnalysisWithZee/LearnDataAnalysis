      <p>The Easy Way Is Often The Best Way, As The More A Data Set Has Been Simplified, The Analysis Performed Will Be That Much More Clarified And For This Reason The Data Set Will Be Cleaned Step By Step In Two Part's, Inconsistency Detection And Outlier Detection And Thus Prepared First For What Comes Next, Data Reporting And Visualisation.</p>

      <p>Before Getting Into The Data Set And Starting Cleaning Is Essential To Be Comfortable With The Project Structure So Is Known What Is Where And Why.</p>
      
      <p>Let Us Summarise:</p>
