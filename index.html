      <h3>ðŸ”— Input Channels Process</h3>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Central Entity</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Strong Synonym</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Organisational Terms</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Expose Descriptive Features</strong></li>
      </ol>

      <h4>ðŸ“Œ Central Entity</h4>
      <p>
        Central Entity is derived from the title of the application. For example, if the application is <em>Activity Tracker</em>, then the Central Entity is <strong>Activity</strong>. If it's <em>Expenses Tracker</em>, then the Central Entity is <strong>Expenses</strong>.
      </p>

      <h4>ðŸ“Œ Strong Synonym</h4>
      <p>
        We identify the strongest synonym for the Central Entity. For instance, the strongest synonym for <strong>Activity</strong> is <em>Task</em>, and for <strong>Expenses</strong> it is <em>Expenditures</em>. This synonym becomes the first Input Channel or Data Divisionâ€”commonly referred to as a field.
      </p>

      <h4>ðŸ“Œ Organisational Terms</h4>
      <p>
        These are universal terms that strengthen the input structure. If <strong>Task</strong> is the first field, organisational terms like <em>Date</em> and <em>Time</em> help structure the input. The full list includes:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Date</li>
        <li>Time</li>
        <li>Location</li>
        <li>Session Activities / Session Expenses (based on Central Entity)</li>
        <li>Status</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Note: The fourth term dynamically reflects the plural of the Central Entity. For <strong>Activity</strong>, it's <em>Session Activities</em>. For <strong>Expenses</strong>, it's <em>Session Expenses</em>. This reflects the reality that multiple activities or expenses may occur during a single session.
      </p>

      <h4>ðŸ“Œ Expose Descriptive Features</h4>
      <p>
        This final layer of the Input Channels Process adds <strong>Categorisation</strong> and <strong>Importance</strong> to enrich the data structure. These features are universal and allow deeper exploration as data entries grow.
      </p>
      <p>
        The benefits of Categorisation and Importance include surfacing key insights and adding a storytelling dimension to each record. An optional field, <strong>Notes</strong>, further enhances this by capturing context and nuanceâ€”revealing patterns and meaning after just a few entries.
      </p>

      <p class="educational-note">ðŸŽ“ This framework supports structured input design for scalable data analysisâ€”ideal for transforming raw entries into meaningful insights.</p>
    <section class="data-divisions slide-up">
  <h3>ðŸ“Š Data Divisions - From An Idea To Continuity:</h3>

  <h4>Idea/Conceptual Layer:</h4>
  <p>
    Here Is Speculated What Data Will Be Retrieved, No Real Consideration Can Be Made Yet However What Has Started Is The Desire To Perform Data Operations In Respect To The Idea, As An Example, Expenses Tracker Or Activity Tracker, Being Core Ideas Yet Without Any Guiding Principles.
    Therefore, Is Introduced The Input Channel Process (Study Previous Part) Which Introduces A Formal Way By Which Data Can Be Retrieved.
    The Efficient Retrieval Of Data In No Way Is Sufficient As Is Only Logic Behind The Conceptual Layer, The Theory Indeed But Not Thorough Enough, The Idea Has Evolved And Further Helped, Storing Data, But With All Of This Data Come Complicated Questionâ€™s, In Fact So Complex, Suffices Not To Mention Here.
    Getting On With It, What Now Becomes A Requirement Is The Logic That Will Transform This Idea Into A Physical Phenomenon.
  </p>

  <h4>Key Point To Remember:</h4>
  <p><strong>â€˜Only Available Data Shall = Data Divisionâ€™</strong></p>

  <p>
    We Have Already Mentioned How We Have The Data Now, There Is A Influx Of Data Being Streamlined Into Each Of The Input Channels (Fields) On A Regular Basis. Itâ€™s Implausible To Identify, Even Now, What The Relationship Between The Field(Input Channel) And Valueâ€™s Inside Them Are Trying To Highlight.
    Well, Seeing As We Only Have The Available Data, And To Each Itâ€™s Own, Input Channel, We Can Only Detach The Input Channels From Input Channels And Re-Attach Them To The Input Channels.
    Why Not Do This For Each Input Channel? And Yes, Here Appear The Data Divisions Or Do They?
  </p>

  <h4>So, What Data Divisions Are There Then?</h4>
  <p>
    Well The Suggestion â€˜Detach The Input Channels From Input Channels And Re-Attach Them To The Input Channelsâ€™ Is Close But Letâ€™s Refine, The Central Entity And Itâ€™s Strongest Synonym Or The First Input Channel Needâ€™s To Be Recalled. And What Had Followed Namely The Universal Organisational Terms.
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Join Input Channel Two To Input Channel One, This Pair Is A Unique Data Division.</li>
    <li>Likewise Join Input Channel Three To Input Channel One, This Too Is Its Own Data Division.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
  This Will Stop At The End Of The Organisational Terms, Which Are Six (Study Part 1). These Data Divisions Provide With Far More Clarity As To The Relationship Between The Input Channels And The Values Residing In Each One.
  <br><br>
  <strong>Key Point To Remember:</strong>
  <br>
  â€˜A Data Division Is Two Input Channels That Are Combined, The First Is Always, The First Input Channel, The Stronger Synonym Of The Central Entity And The Second Is Always One Of The Input Channels Which Are Organisational Terms.â€™
</p>
      
  <h4>What Now, That The Data Divisions Have Been Identified?</h4>
  <p>
    Now That There Is,
    â€˜Far More Clarity As To The Relationship Between The Input Channels And The Values Residing In Each Oneâ€™
    What We Can Do Is, Statistical Analysis, Whereby The Count Of Occurrences Of Each Value Is Mapped To Itâ€™s Associative Input Channel Demonstrating The Data Division As An Enhanced Attribute Of The Input Channels.
    Further The Statistical Analysis Is Used To Enhance Conventional Data Analytics In A Complementary Manner To Answer Questions Like What Happened? (Descriptive Analytics), Why Did It Happen? (Diagnostic Analytics) So On So Forth.
    The Result Here Being A Dashboard With Tables And Charts Explaining A Lot More Of, What Was Previously Hidden.
  </p>

  <h4>Why Do We Need A Dashboard?</h4>
  <p>
    A Dashboard Will Constantly Be Updated As The Data In The Data Set Increases, And This Increased Insight Will Result In New Solutions Becoming A Necessity, And The Three Input Channels, Which Expose Descriptive Features (Study Part 1), Will Help To Lay The Foundation For The New Solutions As Automated Flowâ€™s Which Make The Entire Way From Idea To The Physical Implementation An Continual Process Whereby Solutions In The Future Will Too Improve.

  <h3>ðŸ§  Pre-analysis Engine & Statistical Reasoning</h3>
  <p>To Summarise Till Yet, Relational Thinking Were Manipulated Initially And As A Result Input Channels Came Into Effect (Study Part A).<br>
  Key Point To Remember:<br>
  â€˜The Central Entity, Which Is The Focal Point Of Attention, Throughout The Study Of Data, Must Be Derived From The List Of Synonyms To The Key Word, Specifically The â€˜Strongest Synonym And In Doing So, The Formation Of The Structure To House The Data, Namely, The Data Set, Has Begunâ€™.<br>
  Although Many Examples Have Been Provided Earlier, Throughout The Input Channels & Data Divisions Sections Respectively, Let Us Re-cap,<br>
  If The Data Set Required Is In Relation To Expenses Whereby The Demand Is To, Track Spending To Reveal Trends, Then The Key Word Is, Expenses, So From The List Of Synonyms, Expenditures, Is The Strongest Perhaps, Then This Becomes The Central Entity.<br>
  Next, The Structure So Far, As Good, Were Nowhere Near As Insightful To Guide The Data Analytics Process, Therefore An Pre-Analysis Engine Were Carefully Thought Of, Given The Name, â€˜Data Divisionsâ€™.<br>
  Key Point To Remember:<br>
  â€˜A Data Division Is Two Input Channels That Are Combined, The First Is Always, The First Input Channel, The Stronger Synonym Of The Central Entity And The Second Is Always One Of The Input Channels Which Are Organisational Terms.â€™<br>
  Note: Description Labels Are Extraâ€™s, Optional, However Are Greatly Helpful, Especially When Analysing A Large Data Set Regularly And Therefore Included.<br>
  Having Briefly Touched On What Has Been Covered So Far, Let Us Continue With The Pre-analysis Engine Whereby We Prepare The Data For Analysis.<br>
  Now There Is The Data Set, Still In Itâ€™s Original Form, Then The Data Divisions (The Pre-analysis Engine), Again, Each Data Division Has Two Essential Components, The Central Entity Which Is Always The First Of The Input Channels, Inside Each Data Division, And Then An Organised Input Channel Which Varies From Division To Division.<br>
  The First Step From Hereon Is To Sort The Data Inside The Data Division, At Hand, As Is So Far, Into Alphabetical Order So That Each Value Which Resembles A Value, Is Re-listed As A Collection And Thus We Have Transformed A Data Division.<br>
  The Next Step Is To Extract Information From The Transformed Data Division (We Do Not Need To Keep The Original Data Division Before The Transformation As The Data Set Always Exists Anyway Containing The Records As They Came To Be.<br>
  The Transition From Manipulating Relational Thinking To Quantitative Reasoning<br>
  Once The Data Divisions Have Been Transformed, Statistical Data Collection Is Required. The Statistical Data Collection Will Be Made Within Each Data Division, The Following Is How, Data Division A, Will Be Analysed For An Activity Trackerâ€™s Data Set,<br>
  1.    Central Entity Input Channel -> Task<br>
  2.    Organisational Input Channel -> Date<br>
  3.    Count -> From The Transformed Data Division Count The Number Of Timeâ€™s Each Task Occurred On Each Date.<br>
  4.    Sum -> Sum Of Count Of Tasks Occurring On Each Date.<br>
  5.    Averages -> Average Of Taskâ€™s Occurring On Each Date, Average Of Taskâ€™s Occurring For The Entire Month Overall.<br><br>
  There Will Be An In Depth Demonstration, At The Practical End Of This Tutorial, As To How Exactly The Averages Vary Depending On The Context Of The Data Division At Hand.<br><br>
  A Chart Will Visualise Each Statistical Data Collection, Entitled, Task Centric Statistical Analytics â€“ Data Division A Or B, C, D Or E (Depends On What Data Division Inside).<br><br>
  What Has Been Learned So Far:<br><br>
  1.    Data Model To A Data Set -> Input Channels<br>
  2.    Data Divisions -> Pre-analysis Engine<br>
  3.    Transform Data Divisions -> Sort A-Z Ascending<br>
  4.    Statistical Data Collection -> Chartâ€™s<br><br>
  Investigate Based Upon Evidence, Deduced As A Result Of Statistical Analytics<br>
  A â€˜Compelling Set Of Questionsâ€™ Is The Purpose Of Data Analysis And The Following General Rule Can Be Used To Actually Find The Correct Questions,<br>
  â€˜Central Entity Input Channel + Organisational Input Channel + Organisational Input Channelâ€™<br>
  The Answers To These Questions In Fact The Very Questions Themselves Too, Lead Onto, â€˜AI Driven, Recommendation Systemsâ€™, Which Relying On Machine Learning Extract Information From A Data Set Similar To SQL Queries Do, Only Autonomously, With Little To No Effort In Comparison To SQL Queries. The Recommendation System Will Produce Accurate Recommendations Based On The Analysis Of The Data Set No Matter How Complex Or Large Is.<br>
  The Q & A Allows For A Way To Re-enter The Data Set, With A Lot More Insight To Use To Further Learn From The Data And Extend The Study Of The Data.<br><br>
  The Benefit Of Including Descriptive Input Channels And How They Help The Process<br>
  â€˜Central Entity Input Channel + Descriptive Input Channelâ€™<br>
  The Aforementioned Is One Such Extension To The Study Of Data, Which Will Bring About Advanced Data Divisions Or Super Pre-analysis Engine, Super Statistical Model Collection Resulting In Super Visualisations And Most Importantly Super Questions And Their Answers To Make Yet Even More Informed Decisions Using The Data Set.<br><br>
  Consider So Far The Following (Keep Referring Back To The Theory Above, Until Comfortable For The Practical):<br>
  â€˜Central Entity Input Channel + Organisational Input Channel = Data Divisionâ€™<br>
  â€˜Central Entity Input Channel + Organisational Input Channel + Organisational Input Channelâ€™<br>
  â€˜Central Entity Input Channel + Descriptive Input Channelâ€™
