      <h2>General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)</h2>

    <li>Lawful Basis – Legal reason for collecting and processing personal data (e.g. consent, contract, legal obligation).</li>
    <li>Transparency – Inform individuals about how their data is used, stored and shared.</li>
    <li>Data Minimisation – Only collect the data truly needed.</li>
    <li>Accuracy – Keep the data up to date and correct errors.</li>
    <li>Storage Limitation – Do not keep the data longer than required</li>
    <li>Security – Protect the data using appropriate technical and organisational measures.</li>
    <li>Rights Of Individuals – People possess rights under the GDPR (access, rectification, erasure, portability, objection)</li>

<h2>Consider An Inquiry Using Data Analytics</h2>
      <h3>Performance Register Dataset</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>Object{s} Of Analysis - Performance</li>
        <li>Subject{s} Of Analysis - Demand & Comparison</li>
        <li>GDPR Compliance</li>
        <li>Stakeholders & Their Particular Requirements</li>
      </ol>
        <p>When Considering Data Analysis, Is Important To Become Comfortable With Client Demand.</p>
        <p><i>'A Data Analysts Mindset On The Job Must Be Client-Oriented On Behalf Of Their Contractor/Employer'.</i></p>
        <p>Data, Seems As Is Everywhere, When The Client Introduces The Data Analyst To The Data To Be Analysed, Which May Be In More Than One Place.</p>
        <p>To Officially Recognise The Clients Demand, Classes Of Objects Can Be Created That Categorise The Main Task Flow Of The Client.</p>
        <p><i>'If A Client Is A Cricket Equipent Supplier, A Class Of Objects Could Be, Products, Or Maybe Even, Operational Expenses'.</i></p>
        <p>Once The Object{s} Of Analysis Are Known, Then Satisfying The Clients (Who Is Always A Major Stakeholder) Requirement, Is All Of A Sudden, Realistic.</p>
        <p>As Mentioned Earlier, The Data That Needs To Be Analysed Can Be In More Than One Place, Which Can Be Thought Of As, 'Various Data Sources'.</p>
        <p>The Performance Register Dataset Is A Unified Dataset, Consisting Of Data Imported From These, 'Various Data Sources'.</p>
        <p>The Workflow Of A Data Analyst Must Demonstrate Full Compliance With The GDPR And Respect These Principles, Each Piece Of The Puzzle, In Turn Helps Carve An Helpful And Fruitful Data Analytics Project.</p>
