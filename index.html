    <li>Lawful Basis – Legal reason for collecting and processing personal data (e.g. consent, contract, legal obligation).</li>
    <li>Transparency – Inform individuals about how their data is used, stored and shared.</li>
    <li>Data Minimisation – Only collect the data truly needed.</li>
    <li>Accuracy – Keep the data up to date and correct errors.</li>
    <li>Storage Limitation – Do not keep the data longer than required</li>
    <li>Security – Protect the data using appropriate technical and organisational measures.</li>
    <li>Rights Of Individuals – People possess rights under the GDPR (access, rectification, erasure, portability, objection)</li>

        <li>Populate with sample data to test</li>
      </ol>
